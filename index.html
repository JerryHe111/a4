		<h2>Proposition: Civilian complaints against NYPD officers have increased over time, indicating growing concerns
			about police misconduct.</h2>

		<section>
			<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="up.png" alt="Line chart showing an increase in complaints over time"
					style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
					The number of civilian complaints against NYPD officers has increased significantly over time, with notable
					spikes during key social justice events marked out for better understanding of the trends.
					I also intentionally applied a 6-month rolling average, which highlights a clear upward trend, reinforcing the
					argument that concerns about police misconduct have grown.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Rolling average to smooth fluctuations (Earnest, Score: 1)</strong>
					- A 6-month rolling average was applied to remove short-term noise and highlight the long-term trend.
					- The raw monthly data fluctuates due to seasonality, so the upward trend becomes more straightforward after
					this transformation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Exclusion of 2019 data to maintain a consistent trend (Deceptive, Score: -1.5)</strong>
					- 2019 data was excluded because complaints dropped sharply that year, which could weaken the argument that
					complaints have been steadily rising.
					- This omission subtly makes the increase appear more linear than it actually is.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Color choice to evoke urgency (Deceptive, Score: -1)</strong>
					- The red (lightcoral) color signals urgency and concern. A more neutral color, like blue, would have made the
					trend seem less alarming.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Annotations linking spikes to key events (Earnest, Score: 2)</strong>
					- Major incidents like the Eric Garner case (2014) and the police reform protests (2016) were labeled to show
					correlations with rising complaints.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Truncated Y-axis for a steeper visual impact (Deceptive, Score: -1.5)</strong>
					- The Y-axis was subtly adjusted so even small increases appear more dramatic. This helps emphasize the
					perception of rapid growth.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="down.png" alt="Line chart showing complaints per officer over time" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
					When adjusting for the number of officers, the rate of civilian complaints per officer does not show a
					dramatic increase.
					The introduction of online complaint submissions in the early 2010s may have increased accessibility rather
					than reflecting
					a true rise in police misconduct. A 6-month rolling average was applied to smooth fluctuations, and the
					broader trend
					remains relatively stable.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Normalization by officers instead of raw counts (Earnest, Score: 1)</strong>
					- Instead of plotting total complaints, I divided by the number of active NYPD officers, making it a more
					meaningful measure.
					- This avoids misleading interpretations where a larger police force could naturally result in more complaints
					without an increase in misconduct.
					- To more fairly evaluate the number of complaints received, we definitely need to take into account how large
					is the NYPD department over the years.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Including 2019 data to maintain neutrality (Earnest, Score: 2)</strong>
					- Unlike the "FOR" visualization, this one includes 2019 data, which saw a sharp drop.
					- This choice helps avoid selectively removing data that would otherwise suggest a decline.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Blue color choice to neutralize urgency (Earnest, Score: 0.5)</strong>
					- Unlike the red in the "FOR" chart, I used blue to provide a calmer, more neutral perception of the data.
					- This prevents the immediate emotional reaction that a red trend line could evoke.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Short-term 6-month rolling average to maintain visibility (Neutral, Score: 0)</strong>
					- Instead of a long-term rolling average, I kept it short to preserve visible fluctuations while still
					smoothing minor spikes.
					- This allows the audience to see that complaints per officer fluctuate rather than steadily increasing.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Eliminating data before online complaints were available (Deceptive, Score: -2)</strong>
					- The visualization excludes complaints from before online reporting became widespread, subtly suggesting that
					trends before this point are irrelevant.
					- While online accessibility likely played some role in increasing complaint volume, excluding earlier data
					exaggerates its effect by making it seem like the surge was purely due to reporting changes.
					- Keeping this data would show that complaints per officer had fluctuations long before online reporting,
					making the overall trend appear more gradual.
					- This is actually the main reason this chart looks dramatically different from the FOR chart.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Expanding the Y-axis range to minimize perceived increases (Deceptive, Score: -1)</strong>
					- Unlike the "FOR" graph, I did not truncate the Y-axis. Expanding it flattens the curve and makes the trend
					appear more stable.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

			<p>
				This exercise has been an insightful experience in exploring the balance between ethical visualization and
				persuasive storytelling.
				By working on both sides of the argument, I gained a deeper understanding of how subtle choices—like axis
				scaling, color selection,
				and data filtering—can significantly influence the viewer's perception.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the biggest takeaways was realizing that data transformations, while often applied to enhance
				readability, can also be used
				to reinforce a narrative. For example, applying a rolling average in the "FOR" visualization helped emphasize an
				upward trend, while
				in the "AGAINST" visualization, normalizing by the number of officers helped maintain a more stable perspective.
				Both are technically
				valid transformations, but they serve very different persuasive functions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ethical analysis in visualization is nuanced, as even earnest design choices can have persuasive elements. While
				outright deception
				(such as misrepresenting data) is clearly unethical, techniques like selecting specific time periods, choosing
				impactful colors,
				or framing Y-axis scales exist in a gray area. The key ethical boundary should be ensuring that the data remains
				interpretable and
				that viewers have enough context to critically assess the claims being made. This project reinforced the
				importance of transparency
				and awareness in visual storytelling.
